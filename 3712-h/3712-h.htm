Countries&rdquo; edition by David Price, email

<h1>THE CH&Acirc;TEAU OF PRINCE POLIGNAC.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> Englishmen or Englishwomen are
intimately acquainted with the little town of Le Puy.&nbsp; It is
the capital of the old province of Le Velay, which also is now
but little known, even to French ears, for it is in these days
called by the imperial name of the Department of the Haute
Loire.&nbsp; It is to the south-east of Auvergne, and is nearly
in the centre of the southern half of France.</p>
<p>But few towns, merely as towns, can be better worth
visiting.&nbsp; In the first place, the volcanic formation of the
ground on which it stands is not only singular in the extreme, so
as to be interesting to the geologist, but it is so picturesque
as to be equally gratifying to the general tourist.&nbsp; Within
a narrow valley there stand several rocks, rising up from the
ground with absolute abruptness.&nbsp; Round two of these the
town clusters, and a third stands but a mile distant, forming the
centre of a faubourg, or suburb.&nbsp; These rocks appear to be,
and I believe are, the harder particles of volcanic matter, which
have not been carried away through successive ages by the joint
agency of water and air.</p>
<p>When the tide of lava ran down between the hills the surface
left was no doubt on a level with the heads of these rocks; but
here and there the deposit became harder than elsewhere, and
these harder points have remained, lifting up their steep heads
in a line through the valley.</p>
<p>The highest of these is called the Rocher de Corneille.&nbsp;
Round this and up its steep sides the town stands.&nbsp; On its
highest summit there was an old castle; and there now is, or will
be before these pages are printed, a colossal figure in bronze of
the Virgin Mary, made from the cannon taken at Sebastopol.&nbsp;
Half-way down the hill the cathedral is built, a singularly
gloomy edifice,&mdash;Romanesque, as it is called, in its style,
but extremely similar in its mode of architecture to what we know
of Byzantine structures.&nbsp; But there has been no surface on
the rock side large enough to form a resting-place for the
church, which has therefore been built out on huge supporting
piles, which form a porch below the west front; so that the
approach is by numerous steps laid along the side of the wall
below the church, forming a wondrous flight of stairs.&nbsp; Let
all men who may find themselves stopping at Le Puy visit the top
of these stairs at the time of the setting sun, and look down
from thence through the framework of the porch on the town
beneath, and at the hill-side beyond.</p>
<p>Behind the church is the seminary of the priests, with its
beautiful walks stretching round the Rocher de Corneille, and
overlooking the town and valley below.</p>
<p>Next to this rock, and within a quarter of a mile of it, is
the second peak, called the Rock of the Needle.&nbsp; It rises
narrow, sharp, and abrupt from the valley, allowing of no
buildings on its sides.&nbsp; But on its very point has been
erected a church sacred to St. Michael, that lover of rock
summits, accessible by stairs cut from the stone.&nbsp; This,
perhaps&mdash;this rock, I mean&mdash;is the most wonderful of
the wonders which Nature has formed at La Puy.</p>
<p>Above this, at a mile&rsquo;s distance, is the rock of
Espailly, formed in the same way, and almost equally
precipitous.&nbsp; On its summit is a castle, having its own
legend, and professing to have been the residence of Charles
VII., when little of France belonged to its kings but the
provinces of Berry, Auvergne, and Le Velay.&nbsp; Some three
miles farther up there is another volcanic rock, larger, indeed,
but equally sudden in its spring,&mdash;equally remarkable as
rising abruptly from the valley,&mdash;on which stands the castle
and old family residence of the house of Polignac.&nbsp; It was
lost by them at the Revolution, but was repurchased by the
minister of Charles X., and is still the property of the head of
the race.</p>
<p>Le Puy itself is a small, moderate, pleasant French town, in
which the language of the people has not the pure Parisian aroma,
nor is the glory of the boulevards of the capital emulated in its
streets.&nbsp; These are crooked, narrow, steep, and intricate,
forming here and there excellent sketches for a lover of street
picturesque beauty; but hurtful to the feet with their small,
round-topped paving stones, and not always as clean as pedestrian
ladies might desire.</p>
<p>And now I would ask my readers to join me at the morning table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te at the Hotel des Ambassadeurs.&nbsp; It will
of course be understood that this does not mean a breakfast in
the ordinary fashion of England, consisting of tea or coffee,
bread and butter, and perhaps a boiled egg.&nbsp; It comprises
all the requisites for a composite dinner, excepting soup; and as
one gets farther south in France, this meal is called
dinner.&nbsp; It is, however, eaten without any prejudice to
another similar and somewhat longer meal at six or seven
o&rsquo;clock, which, when the above name is taken up by the
earlier enterprise, is styled supper.</p>
<p>The d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner, or dinner, at the H&ocirc;tel des
Ambassadeurs, on the morning in question, though very elaborate,
was not a very gay affair.&nbsp; There were some fourteen persons
present, of whom half were residents in the town, men employed in
some official capacity, who found this to be the cheapest, the
most luxurious, and to them the most comfortable mode of
living.&nbsp; They clustered together at the head of the table,
and as they were customary guests at the house, they talked their
little talk together&mdash;it was very little&mdash;and made the
most of the good things before them.&nbsp; Then there were two or
three commis-voyageurs, a chance traveller or two, and an English
lady with a young daughter.&nbsp; The English lady sat next to
one of the accustomed guests; but he, unlike the others, held
converse with her rather than with them.&nbsp; Our story at
present has reference only to that lady and to that
gentleman.</p>
<p>Place aux dames.&nbsp; We will speak first of the lady, whose
name was Mrs. Thompson.&nbsp; She was, shall I say, a young woman
of about thirty-six.&nbsp; In so saying, I am perhaps creating a
prejudice against her in the minds of some readers, as they will,
not unnaturally, suppose her, after such an announcement, to be
in truth over forty.&nbsp; Any such prejudice will be
unjust.&nbsp; I would have it believed that thirty-six was the
outside, not the inside of her age.&nbsp; She was good-looking,
lady-like, and considering that she was an Englishwoman, fairly
well dressed.&nbsp; She was inclined to be rather full in her
person, but perhaps not more so than is becoming to ladies at her
time of life.&nbsp; She had rings on her fingers and a brooch on
her bosom which were of some value, and on the back of her head
she wore a jaunty small lace cap, which seemed to tell, in
conjunction with her other appointments, that her circumstances
were comfortable.</p>
<p>The little girl who sat next to her was the youngest of her
two daughters, and might be about thirteen years of age.&nbsp;
Her name was Matilda, but infantine circumstances had invested
her with the nickname of Mimmy, by which her mother always called
her.&nbsp; A nice, pretty, playful little girl was Mimmy
Thompson, wearing two long tails of plaited hair hanging, behind
her head, and inclined occasionally to be rather loud in her
sport.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson had another and an elder daughter, now some
fifteen years old, who was at school in Le Puy; and it was with
reference to her tuition that Mrs. Thompson had taken up a
temporary residence at the H&ocirc;tel des Ambassadeurs in that
town.&nbsp; Lilian Thompson was occasionally invited down to dine
or breakfast at the inn, and was visited daily at her school by
her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m sure that she&rsquo;ll do, I shall leave
her there, and go back to England,&rdquo; Mrs. Thompson had said,
not in the purest French, to the neighbour who always sat next to
her at the table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te, the gentleman, namely, to
whom we have above alluded.&nbsp; But still she had remained at
Le Puy a month, and did not go; a circumstance which was
considered singular, but by no means unpleasant, both by the
innkeeper and by the gentleman in question.</p>
<p>The facts, as regarded Mrs. Thompson, were as
follows:&mdash;She was the widow of a gentleman who had served
for many years in the civil service of the East Indies, and who,
on dying, had left her a comfortable income of&mdash;it matters
not how many pounds, but constituting quite a sufficiency to
enable her to live at her ease and educate her daughters.</p>
<p>Her children had been sent home to England before her
husband&rsquo;s death, and after that event she had followed
them; but there, though she was possessed of moderate wealth, she
had no friends and few acquaintances, and after a little while
she had found life to be rather dull.&nbsp; Her customs were not
those of England, nor were her propensities English; therefore
she had gone abroad, and having received some recommendation of
this school at Le Puy, had made her way thither.&nbsp; As it
appeared to her that she really enjoyed more consideration at Le
Puy than had been accorded to her either at Torquay or
Leamington, there she remained from day to day.&nbsp; The total
payment required at the H&ocirc;tel des Ambassadeurs was but six
francs daily for herself and three and a half for her little
girl; and where else could she live with a better junction of
economy and comfort?&nbsp; And then the gentleman who always sat
next to her was so exceedingly civil!</p>
<p>The gentleman&rsquo;s name was M. Lacordaire.&nbsp; So much
she knew, and had learned to call him by his name very
frequently.&nbsp; Mimmy, too, was quite intimate with M.
Lacordaire; but nothing more than his name was known of
him.&nbsp; But M. Lacordaire carried a general letter of
recommendation in his face, manner, gait, dress, and tone of
voice.&nbsp; In all these respects there was nothing left to be
desired; and, in addition to this, he was decorated, and wore the
little red ribbon of the Legion of Honour, ingeniously twisted
into the shape of a small flower.</p>
<p>M. Lacordaire might be senior in age to Mrs. Thompson by about
ten years, nor had he about him any of the airs or graces of a
would-be young man.&nbsp; His hair, which he wore very short, was
grizzled, as was also the small pretence of a whisker which came
down about as far as the middle of his ear; but the tuft on his
chin was still brown, without a gray hair.&nbsp; His eyes were
bright and tender, his voice was low and soft, his hands were
very white, his clothes were always new and well fitting, and a
better-brushed hat could not be seen out of Paris, nor perhaps in
it.</p>
<p>Now, during the weeks which Mrs. Thompson had passed at La
Puy, the acquaintance which she had formed with M. Lacordaire had
progressed beyond the prolonged meals in the salle &agrave;
manger.&nbsp; He had occasionally sat beside her evening table as
she took her English cup of tea in her own room, her bed being
duly screened off in its distant niche by becoming curtains; and
then he had occasionally walked beside her, as he civilly
escorted her to the lions of the place; and he had once
accompanied her, sitting on the back seat of a French voiture,
when she had gone forth to see something of the surrounding
country.</p>
<p>On all such occasions she had been accompanied by one of her
daughters, and the world of Le Puy had had nothing material to
say against her.&nbsp; But still the world of Le Puy had
whispered a little, suggesting that M. Lacordaire knew very well
what he was about.&nbsp; But might not Mrs. Thompson also know as
well what she was about?&nbsp; At any rate, everything had gone
on very pleasantly since the acquaintance had been made.&nbsp;
And now, so much having been explained, we will go back to the
elaborate breakfast at the H&ocirc;tel des Ambassadeurs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson, holding Mimmy by the hand, walked into the room
some few minutes after the last bell had been rung, and took the
place which was now hers by custom.&nbsp; The gentlemen who
constantly frequented the house all bowed to her, but M.
Lacordaire rose from his seat and offered her his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is Mees Meemy this morning?&rdquo; said he; for
&rsquo;twas thus he always pronounced her name.</p>
<p>Miss Mimmy, answering for herself, declared that she was very
well, and suggested that M. Lacordaire should give her a fig from
off a dish that was placed immediately before him on the
table.&nbsp; This M. Lacordaire did, presenting it very elegantly
between his two fingers, and making a little bow to the little
lady as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie, Mimmy!&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;why do you
ask for the things before the waiter brings them
round?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mamma,&rdquo; said Mimmy, speaking English,
&ldquo;M. Lacordaire always gives me a fig every
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Lacordaire always spoils you, I think,&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Thompson, in French.&nbsp; And then they went
thoroughly to work at their breakfast.&nbsp; During the whole
meal M. Lacordaire attended assiduously to his neighbour; and did
so without any evil result, except that one Frenchman with a
black moustache, at the head of the table, trod on the toe of
another Frenchman with another black moustache&mdash;winking as
he made the sign&mdash;just as M. Lacordaire, having selected a
bunch of grapes, put it on Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s plate with
infinite grace.&nbsp; But who among us all is free from such
impertinences as these?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But madame really must see the ch&acirc;teau of Prince
Polignac before she leaves Le Puy,&rdquo; said M. Lacordaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ch&acirc;teau of who?&rdquo; asked Mimmy, to whose
young ears the French words were already becoming familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Polignac, my dear.&nbsp; Well, I really
don&rsquo;t know, M. Lacordaire;&mdash;I have seen a great deal
of the place already, and I shall be going now very soon;
probably in a day or two,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But madame must positively see the
ch&acirc;teau,&rdquo; said M. Lacordaire, very impressively; and
then after a pause he added, &ldquo;If madame will have the
complaisance to commission me to procure a carriage for this
afternoon, and will allow me the honour to be her guide, I shall
consider myself one of the most fortunate of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, mamma, do go,&rdquo; said Mimmy, clapping her
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it is Thursday, and Lilian can go with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Mimmy, do.&nbsp; Thank you, no, M.
Lacordaire.&nbsp; I could not go to-day; but I am extremely
obliged by your politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Lacordaire still pressed the matter, and Mrs. Thompson
still declined till it was time to rise from the table.&nbsp; She
then declared that she did not think it possible that she should
visit the ch&acirc;teau before she left Le Puy; but that she
would give him an answer at dinner.</p>
<p>The most tedious time in the day to Mrs. Thompson were the two
hours after breakfast.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock she daily went
to the school, taking Mimmy, who for an hour or two shared her
sister&rsquo;s lessons.&nbsp; This and her little excursions
about the place, and her shopping, managed to make away with her
afternoon.&nbsp; Then in the evening, she generally saw something
of M. Lacordaire.&nbsp; But those two hours after breakfast were
hard of killing.</p>
<p>On this occasion, when she gained her own room, she as usual
placed Mimmy on the sofa with a needle.&nbsp; Her custom then was
to take up a novel; but on this morning she sat herself down in
her arm-chair, and resting her head upon her hand and elbow,
began to turn over certain circumstances in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Mimmy, &ldquo;why won&rsquo;t you go
with M. Lacordaire to that place belonging to the prince?&nbsp;
Prince&mdash;Polly something, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your work, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do so wish you&rsquo;d go, mamma.&nbsp; What was
the prince&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polignac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, ain&rsquo;t princes very great
people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear; sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Prince Polly-nac like our Prince Alfred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear; not at all.&nbsp; At least, I suppose
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is his mother a queen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then his father must be a king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear.&nbsp; It is quite a different thing
here.&nbsp; Here in France they have a great many
princes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate I should like to see a prince&rsquo;s
ch&acirc;teau; so I do hope you&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then there was a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mamma, could it come to
pass, here in France, that M. Lacordaire should ever be a
prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Lacordaire a prince!&nbsp; No; don&rsquo;t talk such
nonsense, but mind your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t M. Lacordaire a very nice man?&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t you very fond of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question Mrs. Thompson made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; continued Mimmy, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you tell me whether you are fond of M.
Lacordaire?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite sure of this,&mdash;that
he&rsquo;s very fond of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Thompson,
who could not bring herself to refrain from the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he looks at you in that way, mamma, and
squeezes your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson; &ldquo;hold
your tongue.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what can have put such
stuff into your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he does, mamma,&rdquo; said Mimmy, who rarely
allowed her mother to put her down.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson made no further answer, but again sat with her
head resting on her hand.&nbsp; She also, if the truth must be
told, was thinking of M. Lacordaire and his fondness for
herself.&nbsp; He had squeezed her hand and he had looked into
her face.&nbsp; However much it may have been nonsense on
Mimmy&rsquo;s part to talk of such things, they had not the less
absolutely occurred.&nbsp; Was it really the fact that M.
Lacordaire was in love with her?</p>
<p>And if so, what return should she, or could she make to such a
passion?&nbsp; He had looked at her yesterday, and squeezed her
hand to-day. Might it not be probable that he would advance a
step further to-morrow?&nbsp; If so, what answer would she be
prepared to make to him?</p>
<p>She did not think&mdash;so she said to herself&mdash;that she
had any particular objection to marrying again.&nbsp; Thompson
had been dead now for four years, and neither his friends, nor
her friends, nor the world could say she was wrong on that
score.&nbsp; And as to marrying a Frenchman, she could not say
she felt within herself any absolute repugnance to doing
that.&nbsp; Of her own country, speaking of England as such, she,
in truth, knew but little&mdash;and perhaps cared less.&nbsp; She
had gone to India almost as a child, and England had not been
specially kind to her on her return.&nbsp; She had found it dull
and cold, stiff, and almost ill-natured.&nbsp; People there had
not smiled on her and been civil as M. Lacordaire had done.&nbsp;
As far as England and Englishmen were considered she saw no
reason why she should not marry M. Lacordaire.</p>
<p>And then, as regarded the man; could she in her heart say that
she was prepared to love, honour, and obey M. Lacordaire?&nbsp;
She certainly knew no reason why she should not do so.&nbsp; She
did not know much of him, she said to herself at first; but she
knew as much, she said afterwards, as she had known personally of
Mr. Thompson before their marriage.&nbsp; She had known, to be
sure, what was Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s profession and what his
income; or, if not, some one else had known for her.&nbsp; As to
both these points she was quite in the dark as regarded M.
Lacordaire.</p>
<p>Personally, she certainly did like him, as she said to herself
more than once.&nbsp; There was a courtesy and softness about him
which were very gratifying to her; and then, his appearance was
so much in his favour.&nbsp; He was not very young, she
acknowledged; but neither was she young herself.&nbsp; It was
quite evident that he was fond of her children, and that he would
be a kind and affectionate father to them.&nbsp; Indeed, there
was kindness in all that he did.</p>
<p>Should she marry again,&mdash;and she put it to herself quite
hypothetically,&mdash;she would look for no romance in such a
second marriage.&nbsp; She would be content to sit down in a
quiet home, to the tame dull realities of life, satisfied with
the companionship of a man who would be kind and gentle to her,
and whom she could respect and esteem.&nbsp; Where could she find
a companion with whom this could be more safely anticipated than
with M. Lacordaire?</p>
<p>And so she argued the question within her own breast in a
manner not unfriendly to that gentleman.&nbsp; That there was as
yet one great hindrance she at once saw; but then that might be
remedied by a word.&nbsp; She did not know what was his income or
his profession.&nbsp; The chambermaid, whom she had interrogated,
had told her that he was a &ldquo;marchand.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
merchants, generally, she felt that she had no objection.&nbsp;
The Barings and the Rothschilds were merchants, as was also that
wonderful man at Bombay, Sir Hommajee Bommajee, who was worth she
did no know how many thousand lacs of rupees.</p>
<p>That it would behove her, on her own account and that of her
daughters, to take care of her own little fortune in contracting
any such connection, that she felt strongly.&nbsp; She would
never so commit herself as to put security in that respect out of
her power.&nbsp; But then she did not think that M. Lacordaire
would ever ask her to do so; at any rate, she was determined on
this, that there should never be any doubt on that matter; and as
she firmly resolved on this, she again took up her book, and for
a minute or two made an attempt to read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Mummy, &ldquo;will M. Lacordaire go
up to the school to see Lilian when you go away from
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I cannot say, my dear.&nbsp; If Lilian is a
good girl, perhaps he may do so now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will he write to you and tell you how she
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lilian can write for herself; can she not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I suppose she can; but I hope M. Lacordaire
will write too.&nbsp; We shall come back here some day;
shan&rsquo;t we, mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do so hope we shall see M. Lacordaire again.&nbsp; Do
you know what I was thinking, mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little girls like you ought not to think,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Thompson, walking slowly out of the room to the top of the
stairs and back again; for she had felt the necessity of
preventing Mimmy from disclosing any more of her thoughts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now, my dear, get yourself ready, and we will go up to
the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson always dressed herself with care, though not in
especially fine clothes, before she went down to dinner at the
table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te; but on this occasion she was more than
usually particular.&nbsp; She hardly explained to herself why she
did this; but, nevertheless, as she stood before the glass, she
did in a certain manner feel that the circumstances of her future
life might perhaps depend on what might be said and done that
evening.&nbsp; She had not absolutely decided whether or no she
would go to the Prince&rsquo;s ch&acirc;teau; but if she did
go&mdash;.&nbsp; Well, if she did; what then?&nbsp; She had sense
enough, as she assured herself more than once, to regulate her
own conduct with propriety in any such emergency.</p>
<p>During the dinner, M. Lacordaire conversed in his usual
manner, but said nothing whatever about the visit to
Polignac.&nbsp; He was very kind to Mimmy, and very courteous to
her mother, but did not appear to be at all more particular than
usual.&nbsp; Indeed, it might be a question whether he was not
less so.&nbsp; As she had entered the room Mrs. Thompson had said
to herself that, perhaps, after all, it would be better that
there should be nothing more thought about it; but before the
four of five courses were over, she was beginning to feel a
little disappointed.</p>
<p>And now the fruit was on the table, after the consumption of
which it was her practice to retire.&nbsp; It was certainly open
to her to ask M. Lacordaire to take tea with her that evening, as
she had done on former occasions; but she felt that she must not
do this now, considering the immediate circumstances of the
case.&nbsp; If any further steps were to be taken, they must be
taken by him, and not by her;&mdash;or else by Mimmy, who, just
as her mother was slowly consuming her last grapes, ran round to
the back of M. Lacordaire&rsquo;s chair, and whispered something
into his ear.&nbsp; It may be presumed that Mrs. Thompson did not
see the intention of the movement in time to arrest it, for she
did nothing till the whispering had been whispered; and then she
rebuked the child, bade her not to be troublesome, and with more
than usual austerity in her voice, desired her to get herself
ready to go up stairs to their chamber.</p>
<p>As she spoke she herself rose from her chair, and made her
final little bow to the table, and her other final little bow and
smile to M. Lacordaire; but this was certain to all who saw it,
that the smile was not as gracious as usual.</p>
<p>As she walked forth, M. Lacordaire rose from his
chair&mdash;such being his constant practice when she left the
table; but on this occasion he accompanied her to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has madame decided,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;whether
she will permit me to accompany her to the
ch&acirc;teau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mees Meemy,&rdquo; continued M. Lacordaire, &ldquo;is
very anxious to see the rock, and I may perhaps hope that Mees
Lilian would be pleased with such a little excursion.&nbsp; As
for myself&mdash;&rdquo; and then M. Lacordaire put his hand upon
his heart in a manner that seemed to speak more plainly than he
had ever spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the children would really like it,
and&mdash;as you are so very kind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson; and
so the matter was conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow afternoon?&rdquo; suggested M.
Lacordaire.&nbsp; But Mrs. Thompson fixed on Saturday, thereby
showing that she herself was in no hurry for the expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rdquo; said Mimmy, when they had
re-entered their own room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mamma, do let me tell
Lilian myself when I go up to the school to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But mamma was in no humour to say much to her child on this
subject at the present moment.&nbsp; She threw herself back on
her sofa in perfect silence, and began to reflect whether she
would like to sign her name in future as Fanny Lacordaire,
instead of Fanny Thompson.&nbsp; It certainly seemed as though
things were verging towards such a necessity.&nbsp; A
marchand!&nbsp; But a marchand of what?&nbsp; She had an
instinctive feeling that the people in the hotel were talking
about her and M. Lacordaire, and was therefore more than ever
averse to asking any one a question.</p>
<p>As she went up to the school the next afternoon, she walked
through more of the streets of Le Puy than was necessary, and in
every street she looked at the names which she saw over the doors
of the more respectable houses of business.&nbsp; But she looked
in vain.&nbsp; It might be that M. Lacordaire was a marchand of
so specially high a quality as to be under no necessity to put up
his name at all.&nbsp; Sir Hommajee Bommajee&rsquo;s name did not
appear over any door in Bombay;&mdash;at least, she thought
not.</p>
<p>And then came the Saturday morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall be
ready at two,&rdquo; she said, as she left the breakfast-table;
&ldquo;and perhaps you would not mind calling for Lilian on the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Lacordaire would be delighted to call anywhere for anybody
on behalf of Mrs. Thompson; and then, as he got to the door of
the salon, he offered her his hand.&nbsp; He did so with so much
French courtesy that she could not refuse it, and then she felt
that his purpose was more tender than ever it had been.&nbsp; And
why not, if this was the destiny which Fate had prepared for
her?</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson would rather have got into the carriage at any
other spot in Le Puy than at that at which she was forced to do
so&mdash;the chief entrance, namely, of the H&ocirc;tel des
Ambassadeurs.&nbsp; And what made it worse was this, that an
appearance of a special fate was given to the occasion.&nbsp; M.
Lacordaire was dressed in more than his Sunday best.&nbsp; He had
on new yellow kid gloves.&nbsp; His coat, if not new, was newer
than any Mrs. Thompson had yet observed, and was lined with silk
up to the very collar.&nbsp; He had on patent leather boots,
which glittered, as Mrs. Thompson thought, much too
conspicuously.&nbsp; And as for his hat, it was quite evident
that it was fresh that morning from the maker&rsquo;s block.</p>
<p>In this costume, with his hat in his hand, he stood under the
great gateway of the hotel, ready to hand Mrs. Thompson into the
carriage.&nbsp; This would have been nothing if the landlord and
landlady had not been there also, as well as the man-cook, and
the four waiters, and the fille de chambre.&nbsp; Two or three
other pair of eyes Mrs. Thompson also saw, as she glanced round,
and then Mimmy walked across the yard in her best clothes with a
f&ecirc;te-day air about her for which her mother would have
liked to have whipped her.</p>
<p>But what did it matter?&nbsp; If it was written in the book
that she should become Madame Lacordaire, of course the world
would know that there must have been some preparatory
love-making.&nbsp; Let them have their laugh; a good husband
would not be dearly purchased at so trifling an expense.&nbsp;
And so they sallied forth with already half the ceremony of a
wedding.</p>
<p>Mimmy seated herself opposite to her mother, and M. Lacordaire
also sat with his back to the horses, leaving the second place of
honour for Lilian.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray make yourself comfortable,
M. Lacordaire, and don&rsquo;t mind her,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Thompson.&nbsp; But he was firm in his purpose of civility,
perhaps making up his mind that when he should in truth stand in
the place of papa to the young lady, then would be his time for
having the back seat in the carnage.</p>
<p>Lilian, also in her best frock, came down the school-steps,
and three of the school teachers came with her.&nbsp; It would
have added to Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s happiness at that moment if
M. Lacordaire would have kept his polished boots out of sight,
and put his yellow gloves into his pocket.</p>
<p>And then they started.&nbsp; The road from Le Puy to Polignac
is nearly all up hill; and a very steep hill it is, so that there
was plenty of time for conversation.&nbsp; But the girls had it
nearly all to themselves.&nbsp; Mimmy thought that she had never
found M. Lacordaire so stupid; and Lilian told her sister on the
first safe opportunity that occurred, that it seemed very much as
though they were all going to church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do any of the Polignac people ever live at this
place?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Thompson, by way of making conversation;
in answer to which M. Lacordaire informed madame that the place
was at present only a ruin; and then there was again silence till
they found themselves under the rock, and were informed by the
driver that the rest of the ascent must be made on foot.</p>
<p>The rock now stood abrupt and precipitous above their
heads.&nbsp; It was larger in its circumference and with much
larger space on its summit than those other volcanic rocks in and
close to the town; but then at the same time it was higher from
the ground, and quite as inaccessible, except by the single path
which led up to the ch&acirc;teau.</p>
<p>M. Lacordaire, with conspicuous gallantry, first assisted Mrs.
Thompson from the carriage, and then handed down the two young
ladies.&nbsp; No lady could have been so difficult to please as
to complain of him, and yet Mrs. Thompson thought that he was not
as agreeable as usual.&nbsp; Those horrid boots and those horrid
gloves gave him such an air of holiday finery that neither could
he be at his ease wearing them, nor could she, in seeing them
worn.</p>
<p>They were soon taken in hand by the poor woman whose privilege
it was to show the ruins.&nbsp; For a little distance they walked
up the path in single file; not that it was too narrow to
accommodate two, but M. Lacordaire&rsquo;s courage had not yet
been screwed to a point which admitted of his offering his arm to
the widow.&nbsp; For in France, it must be remembered, that this
means more than it does in some other countries.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson felt that all this was silly and useless.&nbsp;
If they were not to be dear friends this coming out f&ecirc;ting
together, those boots and gloves and new hat were all very
foolish; and if they were, the sooner they understood each other
the better.&nbsp; So Mrs. Thompson, finding that the path was
steep and the weather warm, stood still for a while leaning
against the wall, with a look of considerable fatigue in her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will madame permit me the honour of offering her my
arm?&rdquo; said M. Lacordaire.&nbsp; &ldquo;The road is so
extraordinarily steep for madame to climb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson did permit him the honour, and so they went on
till they reached the top.</p>
<p>The view from the summit was both extensive and grand, but
neither Lilian nor Mimmy were much pleased with the place.&nbsp;
The elder sister, who had talked over the matter with her school
companions, expected a fine castle with turrets, battlements, and
romance; and the other expected a pretty smiling house, such as
princes, in her mind, ought to inhabit.</p>
<p>Instead of this they found an old turret, with steps so broken
that M. Lacordaire did not care to ascend them, and the ruined
walls of a mansion, in which nothing was to be seen but the
remains of an enormous kitchen chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the kitchen of the family,&rdquo; said the
guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said the woman, taking them into the
next ruined compartment, &ldquo;was the kitchen of monsieur et
madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! two kitchens?&rdquo; exclaimed Lilian, upon which
M. Lacordaire explained that the ancestors of the Prince de
Polignac had been very great people, and had therefore required
culinary performances on a great scale.</p>
<p>And then the woman began to chatter something about an oracle
of Apollo.&nbsp; There was, she said, a hole in the rock, from
which in past times, perhaps more than a hundred years ago, the
oracle used to speak forth mysterious words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, pointing to a part of the rock
at some distance, &ldquo;was the hole.&nbsp; And if the ladies
would follow her to a little outhouse which was just beyond, she
would show them the huge stone mouth out of which the oracle used
to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lilian and Mimmy both declared at once for seeing the oracle,
but Mrs. Thompson expressed her determination to remain sitting
where she was upon the turf.&nbsp; So the guide started off with
the young ladies; and will it be thought surprising that M.
Lacordaire should have remained alone by the side of Mrs.
Thompson?</p>
<p>It must be now or never, Mrs. Thompson felt; and as regarded
M. Lacordaire, he probably entertained some idea of the same
kind.&nbsp; Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s inclinations, though they had
never been very strong in the matter, were certainly in favour of
the &ldquo;now.&rdquo;&nbsp; M. Lacordaire&rsquo;s inclinations
were stronger.&nbsp; He had fully and firmly made up his mind in
favour of matrimony; but then he was not so absolutely in favour
of the &ldquo;now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s mind, if
one could have read it, would have shown a great objection to
shilly-shallying, as she was accustomed to call it.&nbsp; But M.
Lacordaire, were it not for the danger which might thence arise,
would have seen no objection to some slight further
procrastination.&nbsp; His courage was beginning, perhaps, to
ooze out from his fingers&rsquo; ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare that those girls have scampered away ever so
far,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would madame wish that I should call them back?&rdquo;
said M. Lacordaire, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, dear children! let them enjoy themselves; it
will be a pleasure to them to run about the rock, and I suppose
they will be safe with that woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, quite safe,&rdquo; said M. Lacordaire; and
then there was another little pause.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson was sitting on a broken fragment of a stone just
outside the entrance to the old family kitchen, and M. Lacordaire
was standing immediately before her.&nbsp; He had in his hand a
little cane with which he sometimes slapped his boots and
sometimes poked about among the rubbish.&nbsp; His hat was not
quite straight on his head, having a little jaunty twist to one
side, with reference to which, by-the-bye, Mrs. Thompson then
resolved that she would make a change, should ever the gentleman
become her own property.&nbsp; He still wore his gloves, and was
very smart; but it was clear to see that he was not at his
ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the heat does not incommode you,&rdquo; he said
after a few moments&rsquo; silence.&nbsp; Mrs. Thompson declared
that it did not, that she liked a good deal of heat, and that, on
the whole, she was very well where she was.&nbsp; She was afraid,
however, that she was detaining M. Lacordaire, who might probably
wish to be moving about upon the rock.&nbsp; In answer to which
M. Lacordaire declared that he never could be so happy anywhere
as in her close vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too good to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson,
almost sighing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what my stay here
would have been without your great kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is madame that has been kind to me,&rdquo; said M.
Lacordaire, pressing the handle of his cane against his
heart.</p>
<p>There was then another pause, after which Mrs. Thompson said
that that was all his French politeness; that she knew that she
had been very troublesome to him, but that she would now soon be
gone; and that then, in her own country, she would never forget
his great goodness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame!&rdquo; said M. Lacordaire; and, as he said
it, much more was expressed in his face than in his words.&nbsp;
But, then, you can neither accept nor reject a gentleman by what
he says in his face.&nbsp; He blushed, too, up to his grizzled
hair, and, turning round, walked a step or two away from the
widow&rsquo;s seat, and back again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson the while sat quite still.&nbsp; The displaced
fragment, lying, as it did, near a corner of the building, made
not an uncomfortable chair.&nbsp; She had only to be careful that
she did not injure her hat or crush her clothes, and throw in a
word here and there to assist the gentleman, should occasion
permit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; said M. Lacordaire, on his return from a
second little walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Thompson, perceiving that
M. Lacordaire paused in his speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he began again, and then, as he again
paused, Mrs. Thompson looked up to him very sweetly;
&ldquo;madame, what I am going to say will, I am afraid, seem to
evince by far too great audacity on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson may, perhaps, have thought that, at the present
moment, audacity was not his fault.&nbsp; She replied, however,
that she was quite sure that monsieur would say nothing that was
in any way unbecoming either for him to speak or for her to
hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, may I have ground to hope that such may be your
sentiments after I have spoken!&nbsp; Madame&rdquo;&mdash;and now
he went down, absolutely on his knees, on the hard stones; and
Mrs. Thompson, looking about into the distance, almost thought
that she saw the top of the guide&rsquo;s
cap&mdash;&ldquo;Madame, I have looked forward to this
opportunity as one in which I may declare for you the greatest
passion that I have ever yet felt. Madame, with all my heart and
soul I love you.&nbsp; Madame, I offer to you the homage of my
heart, my hand, the happiness of my life, and all that I possess
in this world;&rdquo; and then, taking her hand gracefully
between his gloves, he pressed his lips against the tips of her
fingers.</p>
<p>If the thing was to be done, this way of doing it was,
perhaps, as good as any other.&nbsp; It was one, at any rate,
which left no doubt whatever as to the gentleman&rsquo;s
intentions.&nbsp; Mrs. Thompson, could she have had her own way,
would not have allowed her lover of fifty to go down upon his
knees, and would have spared him much of the romance of his
declaration.&nbsp; So also would she have spared him his yellow
gloves and his polished boots.&nbsp; But these were a part of the
necessity of the situation, and therefore she wisely took them as
matters to be passed over with indifference.&nbsp; Seeing,
however, that M. Lacordaire still remained on his knees, it was
necessary that she should take some step toward raising him,
especially as her two children and the guide would infallibly be
upon them before long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Lacordaire,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you surprise me
greatly; but pray get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will madame vouchsafe to give me some small ground
for hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girls will be here directly, M. Lacordaire; pray
get up.&nbsp; I can talk to you much better if you will stand up,
or sit down on one of these stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Lacordaire did as he was bid; he got up, wiped the knees of
his pantaloons with his handkerchief, sat down beside her, and
then pressed the handle of his cane to his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really have so surprised me that I hardly know how
to answer you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, I
cannot bring myself to imagine that you are in
earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame, do not be so cruel!&nbsp; How can I have
lived with you so long, sat beside you for so many days, without
having received your image into my heart?&nbsp; I am in
earnest!&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I fear too much in
earnest!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he looked at her with all his
eyes, and sighed with all his strength.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s prudence told her that it would be well
to settle the matter, in one way or the other, as soon as
possible.&nbsp; Long periods of love-making were fit for younger
people than herself and her future possible husband.&nbsp; Her
object would be to make him comfortable if she could, and that he
should do the same for her, if that also were possible.&nbsp; As
for lookings and sighings and pressings of the hand, she had gone
through all that some twenty years since in India, when Thompson
had been young, and she was still in her teens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, M. Lacordaire, there are so many things to be
considered.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; I hear the children coming!&nbsp;
Let us walk this way for a minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they turned
behind a wall which placed them out of sight, and walked on a few
paces till they reached a parapet, which stood on the uttermost
edge of the high rock.&nbsp; Leaning upon this they continued
their conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are so many things to be considered,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Thompson again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; said M. Lacordaire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But my one great consideration is this;&mdash;that I love
madame to distraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much flattered; of course, any lady would so
feel.&nbsp; But, M. Lacordaire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, I am all attention.&nbsp; But, if you would
deign to make me happy, say that one word, &lsquo;I love
you!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; M. Lacordaire, as he uttered these
words, did not look, as the saying is, at his best.&nbsp; But
Mrs. Thompson forgave him.&nbsp; She knew that elderly gentlemen
under such circumstances do not look at their best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I consented to&mdash;to&mdash;to such an
arrangement, I could only do so on seeing that it would be
beneficial&mdash;or, at any rate, not injurious&mdash;to my
children; and that it would offer to ourselves a fair promise of
future happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame; it would be the dearest wish of my heart to
be a second father to those two young ladies; except,
indeed&mdash;&rdquo; and then M. Lacordaire stopped the flow of
his speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such matters it is so much the best to be explicit
at once,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; certainly!&nbsp; Nothing can be more wise than
madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the happiness of a household depends so much on
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me say a word or two, Monsieur Lacordaire.&nbsp; I
have enough for myself and my children; and, should I every marry
again, I should not, I hope, be felt as a burden by my husband;
but it would, of course, be my duty to know what were his
circumstances before I accepted him.&nbsp; Of yourself,
personally, I have seen nothing that I do not like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, madame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as yet I know nothing of your
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Lacordaire, perhaps, did feel that Mrs. Thompson&rsquo;s
prudence was of a strong, masculine description; but he hardly
liked her the less on this account.&nbsp; To give him his due he
was not desirous of marrying her solely for her money&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; He also wished for a comfortable home, and proposed
to give as much as he got; only he had been anxious to wrap up
the solid cake of this business in a casing of sugar of
romance.&nbsp; Mrs. Thompson would not have the sugar but the
cake might not be the worse on that account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madame, not as yet; but they shall all be made open
and at your disposal,&rdquo; said M. Lacordaire; and Mrs.
Thompson bowed approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in business,&rdquo; continued M. Lacordaire;
&ldquo;and my business gives me eight thousand francs a
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four times eight are thirty-two,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Thompson to herself; putting the francs into pounds sterling, in
the manner that she had always found to be the readiest.&nbsp;
Well, so far the statement was satisfactory.&nbsp; An income of
three hundred and twenty pounds a year from business, joined to
her own, might do very well.&nbsp; She did not in the least
suspect M. Lacordaire of being false, and so far the matter
sounded well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the business?&rdquo; she asked, in a tone
of voice intended to be indifferent, but which nevertheless
showed that she listened anxiously for an answer to her
question.</p>
<p>They were both standing with their arms upon the wall, looking
down upon the town of Le Puy; but they had so stood that each
could see the other&rsquo;s countenance as they talked.&nbsp;
Mrs. Thompson could now perceive that M. Lacordaire became red in
the face, as he paused before answering her.&nbsp; She was near
to him, and seeing his emotion gently touched his arm with her
hand.&nbsp; This she did to reassure him, for she saw that he was
ashamed of having to declare that he was a tradesman.&nbsp; As
for herself, she had made up her mind to bear with this, if she
found, as she felt sure she would find, that the trade was one
which would not degrade either him or her.&nbsp; Hitherto,
indeed,&mdash;in her early days,&mdash;she had looked down on
trade; but of what benefit had her grand ideas been to her when
she had returned to England?&nbsp; She had tried her hand at
English genteel society, and no one had seemed to care for
her.&nbsp; Therefore, she touched his arm lightly with her
fingers that she might encourage him.</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, as I have said, and became red; and
then feeling that he had shown some symptoms of shame&mdash;and
feeling also, probably, that it was unmanly in him to do so, he
shook himself slightly, raised his head up somewhat more proudly
than was his wont, looked her full in the face with more strength
of character than she had yet seen him assume; and then, declared
his business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, in a very audible, but not in a
loud voice, &ldquo;madame&mdash;je suis tailleur.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And having so spoken, he turned slightly from her and looked down
over the valley towards Le Puy.</p>
<p>There was nothing more said upon the subject as they drove
down from the rock of Polignac back to the town.&nbsp;
Immediately on receiving the announcement, Mrs. Thompson found
that she had no answer to make.&nbsp; She withdrew her
hand&mdash;and felt at once that she had received a blow.&nbsp;
It was not that she was angry with M. Lacordaire for being a
tailor; nor was she angry with him in that, being a tailor, he
had so addressed her.&nbsp; But she was surprised, disappointed,
and altogether put beyond her ease.&nbsp; She had, at any rate,
not expected this.&nbsp; She had dreamed of his being a banker;
thought that, perhaps, he might have been a wine merchant; but
her idea had never gone below a jeweller or watchmaker.&nbsp;
When those words broke upon her ear, &ldquo;Madame, je suis
tailleur,&rdquo; she had felt herself to be speechless.</p>
<p>But the words had not been a minute spoken when Lilian and
Mimmy ran up to their mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, mamma,&rdquo; said
Lilian, &ldquo;we thought you were lost; we have searched for you
all over the ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been sitting very quietly here, my dear,
looking at the view,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mamma, I do wish you&rsquo;d see the mouth of the
oracle.&nbsp; It is so large, and so round, and so ugly.&nbsp; I
put my arm into it all the way,&rdquo; said Mimmy.</p>
<p>But at the present moment her mamma felt no interest in the
mouth of the oracle; and so they all walked down together to the
carriage.&nbsp; And, though the way was steep, Mrs. Thompson
managed to pick her steps without the assistance of an arm; nor
did M. Lacordaire presume to offer it.</p>
<p>The drive back to town was very silent.&nbsp; Mrs. Thompson
did make one or two attempts at conversation, but they were not
effectual.&nbsp; M. Lacordaire could not speak at his ease till
this matter was settled, and he already had begun to perceive
that his business was against him.&nbsp; Why is it that the trade
of a tailor should be less honourable than that of a haberdasher,
or even a grocer?</p>
<p>They sat next each other at dinner, as usual; and here, as all
eyes were upon them, they both made a great struggle to behave in
their accustomed way.&nbsp; But even in this they failed.&nbsp;
All the world of the H&ocirc;tel des Ambassadeurs knew that M.
Lacordaire had gone forth to make an offer to Mrs. Thompson, and
all that world, therefore, was full of speculation.&nbsp; But all
the world could make nothing of it.&nbsp; M. Lacordaire did look
like a rejected man, but Mrs. Thompson did not look like the
woman who had rejected him.&nbsp; That the offer had been
made&mdash;in that everybody agreed, from the senior
habitu&eacute; of the house who always sat at the head of the
table, down to the junior assistant gar&ccedil;on.&nbsp; But as
to reading the riddle, there was no accord among them.</p>
<p>When the dessert was done, Mrs. Thompson, as usual, withdrew,
and M. Lacordaire, as usual, bowed as he stood behind his own
chair.&nbsp; He did not, however, attempt to follow her.</p>
<p>But when she reached the door she called him.&nbsp; He was at
her side in a moment, and then she whispered in his
ear&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, also&mdash;I will be of the same
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When M. Lacordaire regained the table the senior
habitu&eacute;, the junior gar&ccedil;on, and all the
intermediate ranks of men at the H&ocirc;tel des Ambassadeurs
knew that they might congratulate him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson had made a great struggle; but, speaking for
myself, I am inclined to think that she arrived at last at a wise
decision.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
